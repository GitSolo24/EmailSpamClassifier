we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto sitara and tds we do see some potential for this happening again towards the end of this month and the beginning of next month the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts along with updates to those deals a large portion of these updates come to sitara via the unify bridge back process it would be ideal if we could continue to have the unify data cleaned scrubbed week to week and try to avoid having the bulk of the month being updated bridged in the final week days of the month i know this is the goal of logistics but i just want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on the gas trading systems perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month would help another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to have months active at a time in other words when november is over and we are in the first week or two of december sitara continues to maintain positions for november this november data degrades the ability to update december positions in a timely manner we may find ourselves having to remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in the past i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days weeks to implement some combination of quick fixes as well as look into the long term changes necessary to support our increased trading business please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area thanks d n', 'subject re cornhusker deal rita things have been

enron subject re copano that is not what i am conveying there may be changes made to the set flow periodically but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of the copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their system whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city gate our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline our instructions should only come from entex to change the set point and should be confirmed with copano we are not to provide any instantaneous swing service on the copano lake creek lateral any swing provided by hpl for the woodland s load will be made into the copano formerly ksc line as historically done there may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek lateral because of the revised set point but that is something that entex has negotiated with copano independent of hpl still fuzzy edward d gottlob am to
